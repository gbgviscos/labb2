# Labb 2 - "Sports Freaks" 

## How to start

to start the project first run `npm run json-server`
open a new terminal
secondary run `npm start`

## What kind of app is this:

The app should show the skill to create and set up a webpage using React.
In this app, I focused on the useContext building up a smooth user interaction. 

there are multiple users to use and the ability to create a user. 
Test users:
### Normal User
username: test, password 1234

### Admin User
username: admin, password 1234 < Admin user >

### Functionality added:

### Ability to: 
#### As a new potential user:
Register with a very basic validation to avoid duplicated users and missing information

#### As a normal user: 
Login, Join events, View what users are signed up for events.

#### As admin user:
user actions + Create Events, Remove Events

### Functions added, later removed:

Modify events, using modal it was using to much boilerplate code and it was cumbersome to build it from scratch.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
